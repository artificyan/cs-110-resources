Academic Dishonesty
------

Students are required to follow the University’s Honor Code:

> “As a Jesuit institution committed to cura personalis – the care and education of the whole person – USF has an obligation to embody and foster the values of honesty and integrity. USF upholds the standards of honesty and integrity from all members of the academic community. All students are expected to know and adhere to the University’s Honor Code.”  

You can find the full text of the code online at www.usfca.edu/fogcutter.

This includes but is not limited to the following:

- All assignments are to be completed individually unless specified, in writing, on the assignment. Academic dishonesty will NOT be tolerated. This is your warning! Students are  encouraged to meet with me if they have questions regarding assignments or this policy.

Students caught cheating will face severe penalties.

Students may: 

- Receive help from the professor and the TA.
- Discuss the requirements of assignments, bugs and general problems they have having making a program work properly, or high-level algorithms with other students or outside sources.

Students may __NOT__: 

- Copy another student’s code.
- Submit code or problem solutions which have, in whole or in part, been copied from any other source (including another student, a web page, or another text) or written by anyone other than the student.
- Receive unapproved help from an outside source, including a tutor or a internet.
 
Submitted code will be cross-checked for code that appears copied between students.
If you have any doubt with respect to what is acceptable to discuss, speak with the professor first.

Penalties:

Students caught violating the academic honesty policy will face severe penalties. A first offense will result in a zero on the assignment and possibly a report to the Chair of the Department’s office.  A second offense will result in the student receiving an F grade for the course.
